Whisperfish
===============================================================================

Whisperfish is a native `Signal <https://www.whispersystems.org/>`_ client for
`Sailfish OS <https://sailfishos.org/>`_. The user interface is heavily based on
the jolla-messages application written by Jolla Ltd.

It is currently mostly working state.  Join our development channel on Matrix
(`#whisperfish:rubdos.be <https://matrix.to/#/#whisperfish:rubdos.be>`_) or
Freenode (#whisperfish) to get in touch, and check
`our wiki <https://gitlab.com/rubdos/whisperfish/-/wikis/home>`_ to see whether
Whisperfish would work for you.

To install, you have two options:

- Releases `from OpenRepos <https://openrepos.net/content/rubdos/whisperfish>`_
- "Nightly" builds from the master branch (see below).

There's no particular reason to install from the master branch directly.  We
push regular updates to OpenRepos.

Please mind that Whisperfish in still in *alpha condition*, which means that
certain things do not work, other things make the application crash, and I've
heard reports that alpha software can be a cause for dogs eating homework.
You've been warned.
On the other hand, we have many people happily using Whisperfish as daily driver,
and we make up for lacking features in our community support in the aforementioned
Matrix and IRC room.
Please come say hello! We don't bite (we may byte), and we don't eat homework.

Project Status
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project started from a now outdated Go-based SailfishOS client for Signal.
This version, 0.6 and onwards, is a complete rewrite, and uses `libsignal-c-protocol
<https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-c>`_ instead.
This means we aim for better maintainability.
It also means the whole SailfishOS app had to be rewritten, and you may want
to make a back-up of your current files if you still come from 0.5. Specifically:

- `.local/share/harbour-whisperfish/` contains all your data.
- `.config/harbour-whisperfish/` contains the apps configuration.

Performance Tips
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whisperfish connects to Signal using Websockets. For a better user experience
try adjusting the power settings on your Jolla to disable late suspend [1].
This should keep the network interfaces up and allow Whisperfish to maintain
websocket connections even when the device is in "sleep". This could
potentially impact your battery life depending on your usage. Otherwise
every time your device goes into deep sleep, the Websocket connection is broken
and you may not receive messages until the next time the OS wakes up and
Whisperfish reconnects.

To disable late suspend and enable "early suspend" run::

    $ mcetool --set-suspend-policy=early

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building from source
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whisperfish is built using tooling of the *host* operating system.
Currently tested are Debian and Arch Linux for this purpose.
Fedora, notably, does *not* have the necessary infrastructure for this.
By Whisperfish 1.0.0, we want to use the real SailfishOS SDK, since it offers Rust since version 3.4.

1. Clone the repository::

    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/rubdos/whisperfish

2. Whisperfish is built from the `Platform SDK <https://sailfishos.org/wiki/Platform_SDK>`, outside of the classic ``sb2`` and ``mb2`` environments.
   Refer to the Platform SDK page for installation instructions.
   After that, `install the relevant targets <https://sailfishos.org/wiki/Platform_SDK_Target_Installation>` for the device you are building for,
   e.g.::

    sdk-assistant create SailfishOS-latest-armv7hl http://releases.sailfishos.org/sdk/targets/Sailfish_OS-latest-Sailfish_SDK_Target-armv7hl.tar.7z

4. Still in the SDK chroot use ``sdk-manage`` to install the Sqlite-sqlcipher build dependency, together with some other headers::

   sdk-manage develpkg install SailfishOS-latest-armv7hl sqlcipher-devel qt5-qtwebsockets-devel openssl-devel

5. Make a copy of ``dotenv.example`` to ``.env``, adapt it to your configuration and source it.

6. For building on the host, ie. running ``cargo test`` or whatever you may desire, the Debian
   requirements are in ``Dockerfile.builder``, reproduced here::

           $ sudo apt-get install -y \
                   build-essential
                   gcc-i686-linux-gnu g++-i686-linux-gnu binutils-i686-linux-gnu \
                   gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf \
                   gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu \
                   curl \
                   qtbase5-dev \
                   qt5-qmake \
                   qtdeclarative5-dev \
                   qttools5-dev-tools qtchooser qt5-default \
                   desktop-file-utils \
                   rpm \
                   cmake \
                   protobuf-compiler \
                   libsqlcipher-dev

   You will also be needing some Rust things::

           $ rustup toolchain install nightly
           $ rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
           $ cargo install --git https://github.com/RustRPM/cargo-rpm --branch develop

7. Configure your cross compilers: copy ``.ci/cargo.toml`` (which is a working file for Debian)
   to ``~/.cargo/config`` (or to ``.cargo/config`` if you do not like this system-wide configuration),
   and edit as necessary for your host operating systems' cross compilers.

8. From here on, you can use cargo to build the project;
   make sure to have the correct targets installed (rustup target) and a C compiler set,
   and to have sourced ``.env``::

    $ cargo build --release --target=armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf

   Alternatively, you may use the ``run.sh`` script, which copies the RPM to your device.

   The ``harbour-whisperfish`` executable resides in ``target/[target]/release``.
   You can also use ``cargo rpm`` to build an RPM package,
   note that you need ``rpmtools`` installed on the host system::

    $ cargo install cargo-rpm
    $ cargo rpm build

   The generated RPM can be found in ``target/[target]/release/rpmbuild/RPMS/armv7hl/``.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing on the device
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``run.sh`` script will will source the ``.env`` file and run the build on your device.

i18n Translations (help wanted)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whisperfish supports i18n translations and uses Text ID Based Translations. See
`here <http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-id-based-i18n.html>`_ for more info. For
an easy way to help translating, you can join on
`Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/whisperfish/whisperfish-application/>`_.
