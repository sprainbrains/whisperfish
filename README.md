# Whisperfish

Whisperfish is a native [Signal](https://www.whispersystems.org/) client
for [Sailfish OS](https://sailfishos.org/). The user interface is
heavily based on the jolla-messages application written by Jolla Ltd.

The current branch is an adaptation for Aurora OS

## Project Status

This project started from a now outdated Go-based SailfishOS client for
Signal. This version, 0.6 and onwards, is a complete rewrite, and uses
[libsignal-client](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-client)
instead. This means we aim for better maintainability. It also means the
whole SailfishOS app had to be rewritten, and you may want to make a
back-up of your current files if you still come from 0.5. Specifically:

- `.local/share/harbour-whisperfish` contains all your data.
- `.config/harbour-whisperfish` contains the apps configuration.

In current releases the paths have changed:

- `.local/share/be.rubdos/harbour-whisperfish`
- `.config/be.rubdos/harbour-whisperfish`

## Building from source

Whisperfish is written in Rust (and QML), and Rust is a bit of a special
entity in Sailfish OS. Luckily, Jolla has provided a more or less decent
Rust compiler since Sailfish OS 3.4, but it had some issues, which were
[https://github.com/sailfishos/rust/pull/14](fixed) only in Sailfish OS
4.5. Using the corresponding Sailfish SDK 3.10.4 is *highly* recommended.

**Note:** Only the Docker build engine supports Rust compiling. VirtualBox build engine will not work.

Building Whisperfish for yourself is, despite its size and it being a Rust
project, very simple! Just install Sailfish SDK 3.10.4 or newer, download the
source and compile it! (Older SDK versions and build targets work too, but
they need a good amount of setup. Please see
[the previous version](https://gitlab.com/whisperfish/whisperfish/-/blob/1af345a5deb7900e9dd540aacb57b3ba50fb6cd8/README.rst)
of the readme for instructions.)

When you have the Aurora PSDK up and running, and the Whisperfish sources fetched,
it compiles just like any other native Aurora OS/Sailfish OS application.
For Aurora OS you need to set up a patched version of Rust.

1.Make sure you have access to the `sfdk` tool; we will use it for setting
   up the environment.

   Clone Whisperfish to a subdirectory of your SFDK project root,
   just like any other Sailfish OS project.

2.Enable the repository that contains the patched Rust compiler and cargo tooling.
   This repository contains `rubdos.key`, which is used to sign the packages, if you want to check.::

    $ sfdk tools exec SailfishOS-4.4.0.58 \
        ssu ar https://nas.rubdos.be/~rsmet/sailfish-repo/ rubdos
    $ sfdk tools exec SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-aarch64 \
        ssu ar https://nas.rubdos.be/~rsmet/sailfish-repo/ rubdos
    $ sfdk tools exec SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-armv7hl \
        ssu ar https://nas.rubdos.be/~rsmet/sailfish-repo/ rubdos
    $ sfdk tools exec SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-i486 \
        ssu ar https://nas.rubdos.be/~rsmet/sailfish-repo/ rubdos

3.Install the tooling and development packages::

    $ sfdk tools exec SailfishOS-4.4.0.58 \
      zypper install --oldpackage -y \
        rust=1.52.1+git3-1 \
        cargo=1.52.1+git3-1 \
        rust-std-static-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu=1.52.1+git3-1 \
        rust-std-static-armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf=1.52.1+git3-1 \
        rust-std-static-i686-unknown-linux-gnu=1.52.1+git3-1
    $ sfdk engine exec \
      sudo zypper install -y openssl-devel sqlcipher-devel

4.Install the stub compilers.

   For aarch64::

    $ sfdk tools exec SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-armv7hl \
      zypper install --oldpackage --repo rubdos -y \
        rust=1.52.1+git3-1 \
        cargo=1.52.1+git3-1 \
        rust-std-static-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu=1.0+git3-1 \
        rust-std-static-i686-unknown-linux-gnu=1.0+git3-1

   For armv7hl::

    $ sfdk tools exec SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-armv7hl \
      zypper install --oldpackage --repo rubdos -y \
        rust=1.52.1+git3-1 \
        cargo=1.52.1+git3-1 \
        ust-std-static-armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf=1.0+git3-1 \
        rust-std-static-i686-unknown-linux-gnu=1.0+git3-1

   For i486::

    $ sfdk tools exec SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-i486 \
      zypper install --oldpackage --repo rubdos -y \
        rust=1.52.1+git3-1 \
        cargo=1.52.1+git3-1 \
        rust-std-static-i686-unknown-linux-gnu=1.52.1+git3-1

   If there are errors with the commands, you can try adding `--allow-vendor-change`
   to explicitly tell it's ok to use "third-party" packages, and `--force` to
   re-download and re-install packages.

5.You can now proceed to build as you would with a normal SailfishOS application::

   Choose your architecture::

    $ sfdk config --push target SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-aarch64 # or
    $ sfdk config --push target SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-armv7hl # or
    $ sfdk config --push target SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-i486

   Then start the build::

    $ sfdk build

   Or in a single command. e.g. for aarch64::

    $ sfdk -c target=SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-aarch64 build

6.If you want to also build the sharing plugin for SFOS 4.3+, use this command::

    $ sfdk -c target=SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-aarch64 build -- --with shareplugin_v2

   For Sailfish 4.2 and older, use `shareplugin_v1` instead.

## i18n Translations (help wanted)

Whisperfish supports i18n translations and uses
[Text ID Based Translations](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-id-based-i18n.html).
